    "Let's take a look at this hypercube. Here, the four ccccx gates which were defined to check if a certain konbini chain was present in adjacent districts will each correspond to coloring vertex 0000, 0101, 1010, and 1111 of this hypercube. A single ccx gate will correspond to coloring a single plane of a hypercube so, if you can find out the appropriate combination of planes (note: vertices that share even number of planes cancel out each other and cannot be colored), you can replace your four ccccx gates with four ccx gates. Check and see that the following combination of planes would allow you to color 0000, 0101, 1010, 1111 with the right konbinis (colors). Please note that other vertices are not colored because they share an even number of planes. \n",

    "This team has successfully realized a smaller oracle by identifying which districts need only a simple check. From collapsing multiple single-qubits into u3 gates to defining a margolus gate, team Whit3z successfully optimized their circuit to the fine details. Team whit3z was also one of the first teams to submit their code where the cost was initially 164749 but within a week reduced the gate cost to a tenth which was very impressive.  \n",
    "* Second Place Team: **QunaVillage**: cost = $17053$  \n",
    "Team QunaVillage reduced the number of qubits for storing district info. and reduced the solution space effectively. Their technique to check multiple edges at once was also very clever.   \n",
    "* Third Place Team: **IIQ@QIC**: cost = $25490$   \n",
    "An oracle that simultaneously checks edges that does not share the same node was designed effectively. Optimization is applied across the circuit in detail such as in the initialization, corresponding diffusion, and in minimizing u3 gates. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "======<br/>\n",
    "**Special Oracle Award** <br/>\n",
    "Although part of the encoding for initialization was incomplete and was not enough to generate equal probability distributions, we would like to honor and recognize two teams that have shown ingenuity and creativity in how they built their oracles and diffusion functions. The two teams are:<br/>\n",
    "* Team: **Costs > 100k**: $\\approx 15737$  \n",
    "their oracle design, which focuses on the geometric triangle of the graph, was exceptionally creative. With their oracle, they succeeded reduced the solution space dramatically. That is why the organizers have decided to award this team with a Special Oracle Award. \n",
    "* Team: **Sorin**: $\\approx 21667$  \n",
    "Team Sorin uses a unique function `equalsNoCcx()` which provides the same functionality as the color_check() we used in our example. They use only a cx gate and a x gate in this function which returns the district information back into the storage qubit based on the comparison result. This approach allows team Sorin to build an effective oracle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Judges would like to honor the above teams as well as the teams that made it into the top ten teams. Congratulations! <br/>\n",
    "**Check out the top team's submissions and write-ups [here](https://github.com/quantum-challenge/2019/tree/master/top%20ten%20submissions).**  (*We have a few latest additions in terms of the top ten. We will be reaching out to those teams and asking them to upload their submission and write-ups soon.*)\n",

    "Over 700 people joined IBM Quantum Challenge. We were amazed by the ingenuity and creativity of each team especially the teams mentioned above who achieved lower quantum costs beyond the judges' expectation. We were also happy to know that there were many individuals out there who joined this challenge perhaps not necessarily to compete but to learn quantum computation and new techniques. We hope you had as much fun as we did on this wild ride. "
