#IBM Quantum Challenge 2019
#Instructions for top ten teams for preparing their illustrative explanation of their submissions.

Dear Team, 

Congratulations for making it into the top ten teams of IBM Quantum Challenge!

Judges have reviewed your submissions and have verified your final score. We will be making an official announcement next week to show the final standings. 

In the meantime, we are asking all top ten teams to: 


-Prepare a write-up on how your team obtained the answers for the final challenge. 

-You may either add explanations to your ipynb file OR provide detailed comments in your .py file.

-While we do not have a specific format for you to follow, we would like to ask you to focus on providing an illustrative explanation of your strategy, approach, techniques (creativity) you used to achieve lower quantum costs.

-A folder saying 'top ten submissions' will be prepared in the github repository containing another set of folders each named after your teams. Please push your write-ups into these folders by Monday Oct 21st, noon JST.
