    "Zed City is a newly established (fictitious) municipality in Tokyo and is made up of 11 districts. <br/> \n",
    "Four convenience store ( _konbini_ ) chains A, B, C and D have each established their first store in this new city in non-overlapping districts.\n",
    "The map (or graph) below shows the 11 districts of Zed City and which district has a konbini already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this map looks different from a conventional one, let us explain how you should look at it once more just in case.<br/>\n",
    "If you count the number of nodes in this map (or graph), you'll notice that there are 11 of them. So, you should be able to tell that each node in this map (or graph) represents one of the 11 districts of Zed city. The colored nodes are the districts that have konbinis already with each color representing a different konbini chain. In this graph, konbini chain A is represented in Red, B in Blue, C in Yellow and D in Green. Next, you should take notice of the edges that connect these nodes. Any node (district) connected to each other by and edge means that they are districts adjacent to each other.\n",
    "<img src=\"./tokyo_map_pic.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "As the mayor of Zed City, you want to establish konbinis in the rest of the districts that still don't have one yet.<br/>\n",
    "Upon your request, all four konbini chains discussed with each other and agreed to establish their konbinis in Zed City under the following two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**-Only one konbini is allowed in one district.**<br/>\n",
    "**-No two adjacent districts can have konbinis from the same chain.**<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you come up with a plan that satisfies the above conditions? You must provide all store plan combinations that meet the conditions above.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**For solving this problem:**<br/>\n",
    "- Use the 32-qubit QASM simulator as your backend. (i.e. backend = provider.get_backend('ibmq_qasm_simulator'))\n",
    "- Use **Grover's algorithm** you learned in Week2 & 3 with **iteration ＝ 5.**\n",
    "- Each konbini chain A, B, C and D should be described (mapped) as **A: $00$、B:$01$、C:$10$、D:$11$**.\n",
    "- A konbini you are establishing in **district _n_**, should be mapped into classical registers **c[2n]** and **c[2n+1]**.\n",
    "(For example, let's say you want to establish konbini chain B:$01$ into district n=1. In this case, you should map $0$ and $1$ into classical registers c[2] and c[3].)\n",
    "- Make sure you **create an oracle** that **doesn't require any knowledge of what the answers are**. (For example, you are not allowed to create an oracle by using a classical optimization solver to get your answers for it.)  \n",
    "- You are only allowed to use the Unroller as your transpiler pass.\n",
